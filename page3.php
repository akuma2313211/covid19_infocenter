                                                <p>Rather than injecting a whole pathogen to trigger an immune response, subunit vaccines (sometimes called acellular vaccines) contain purified pieces of it, which have been specially selected for their ability to stimulate immune cells. 
													Because these fragments are incapable of causing disease, subunit vaccines are considered very safe. 
													There are several types: protein subunit vaccines contain specific isolated proteins from viral or bacterial pathogens; polysaccharide vaccines contain chains of sugar molecules (polysaccharides) found in the cell walls of some bacteria; conjugate subunit vaccines bind a polysaccharide chain to a carrier protein to try and boost the immune response. 
													Only protein subunit vaccines are being developed against the virus that causes COVID-19.
												</p>
												<p>
													Other subunit vaccines are already in widespread use. 
													Examples include the hepatitis B and acellular pertussis vaccines (protein subunit), the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (polysaccharide), and the MenACWY vaccine, which contains polysaccharides from the surface of four types of the bacteria which causes meningococcal disease joined to diphtheria or tetanus toxoid (conjugate subunit).

                                        <h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left">How Protein Subunit Vaccines Work</h2>
                                        <p>
											Vaccines equip the immune system to recognize future infections with pathogens. 
											Some vaccines use the whole pathogen to do this, but others only use one part.
										</p>
                                        <br>
										<p>
											Subunit vaccines, such as the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine candidate, usually contain either a protein, a polysaccharide — a sugar molecule, or a combination of the two from a pathogen. 
											They are safe because they cannot cause disease.
										</p>
										<br>
                                        <p>
											Because these vaccines contain only a small part of the pathogen, they are less likelyTrusted Source to produce strong side effects. 
											However, they are also less likely to create long-lasting immunity.
										</p>
										<br>
										<p>
											Therefore, many subunit vaccines contain adjuvantsTrusted Source, chemicals that scientists add to the vaccine to elicit a robust immune response.
										</p>
                                        <br>
										<p>
											It is possible to create longer-lasting immunity by combining the small part of the pathogen with an adjuvant. 
											Some subunit vaccines also require booster doses to ensure lasting protection from the disease.
										</p>
										<br>
										<p>
											Examples of subunit vaccines are the whooping coughTrusted Source and hepatitis BTrusted Source vaccines.

                                        <h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left">Effectiveness of Protein Subunit Vaccines</h2>
                                        <p>
											Subunit vaccines, like inactivated whole-cell vaccines, do not contain live components of the pathogen. 
											They differ from inactivated whole-cell vaccines, by containing only the antigenic parts of the pathogen. 
											These parts are necessary to elicit a protective immune response.
										</p>
                                        <br>
										<p>
											This precision comes at a cost, as antigenic properties of the various potential subunits of a pathogen must be examined in detail to determine which particular combinations will produce an effective immune response within the correct pathway.
										</p>
										<br>
                                        <p>
											Often a response can be elicited, but there is no guarantee that immunological memory will be formed in the correct manner.
