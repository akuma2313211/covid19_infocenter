                                                <p>COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the “spike protein.” 
												The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
                                                
                                               <p>COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle. 
											   Once the instructions (mRNA) are inside the immune cells,
											   the cells use them to make the protein piece. After the protein piece is made,
											   the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them.</p>
											   <br>
											   <p>Next, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface.
											   Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies,
											   like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19.</p>
											   <br>
											   <p>At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection. 
											   The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines,
											   is those vaccinated gain this protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19.

                                        <p>Some vaccines use a whole virus or bacterium to teach our bodies how to build up immunity to the pathogen.
										These pathogens are inactivated or attenuated, which means weakened. Other vaccines use parts of viruses or bacteria.</p>
                                        <br>
										<p>Recombinant vaccine technology employs yeast or bacterial cells to made many copies of a particular viral
										or bacterial protein or sometimes a small part of the protein.</p>
										<br>
                                        <p>mRNA vaccines bypass this step. They are chemically synthesized without the need for cells or pathogens,
										making the production process simpler. mRNA vaccines carry the information that allows our own cells to make the pathogen’s proteins or protein fragments themselves.</p>
                                        <br>
										<p>
										Importantly, mRNA vaccines only carry the information to make a small part of a pathogen. From this information, it is not possible for our cells to make the whole pathogen.
										</p>
										<br>
										<p><b>
										Both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have developed cannot cause COVID-19.
										They do not carry the full information for our cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and therefore, cannot cause an infection.<b>
