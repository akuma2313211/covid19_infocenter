                                                <p>Viral vector vaccines are a type of vaccine likely to be among the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States.
												Viral vectors are promising tools for the development of novel vaccines and vaccination 
												approaches. Viral vector-based vaccines present advantages over traditional vaccines in that they can enhance a broad range of 
												immunogenicity without an adjuvant and induce a robust cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to eliminate virus-infected cells. 
												During the last several decades, viral vectors have been extensively studied in animal models, and many types of viruses have been 
												developed as vaccine vectors and entered clinical trials. The most promising method involves "prime-boost" strategies with other 
												types of vaccines such as recombinant antigens or DNA vaccines. Viral vector is a promising system for the development of effective 
												and safe vaccines for many important diseases. Creative Biolabs is professional in a wide range of vaccine technologies including 
												Viral Vector Vaccine. Our scientists are confident in offering the best services and products upon request.</p>

                                        <h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left">How it Works</h2>
										<p>Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. 
										For COVID-19 viral vector vaccines, the vector (not the virus that causes COVID-19, but a different, harmless virus) will enter a 
										cell in our body and then use the cell’s machinery to produce a harmless piece of the virus that causes COVID-19. This piece is known 
										as a spike protein and it is only found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										The cell displays the spike protein on its surface, and our immune system recognizes it doesn’t belong there. 
										This triggers our immune system to begin producing antibodies and activating other immune cells to fight off 
										what it thinks is an infection.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect us against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. 
										The benefit is that we get this protection from a vaccine, without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with 
										COVID-19. Any temporary discomfort experienced after getting the vaccine is a natural part of the process and an indication that the 
										vaccine is working.
										</p>
										
										<br>

										<h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left">Effectiveness of Viral Vector Vaccine</h2>
										<p>
										In the development of viral vector vaccines, several different viruses have been used as vectors, 
										including influenza, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus, and adenovirus, which causes
										the common cold. Adenovirus is one of the viral vectors used in some late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trials.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										In viral vector vaccines, a gene unique to the virus being targeted is added to the viral vector. 
										For COVID-19 vaccines, this gene codes for the spike protein, which is only found on the surface of 
										SARS-CoV-2. The viral vector is used to shuttle this gene into a human cell. Once inside a cell, 
										the viral vector uses this gene and the cell’s machinery to produce the spike protein and display 
										it on the cell’s surface.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										Once displayed on the cell’s surface, the protein (or antigen) causes the immune system to begin producing antibodies and 
										activating T-cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. These antibodies are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 
										which means the immune system is primed to protect against future infection.
										</p>
